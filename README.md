# Hansel & You. Stories alive.
This project has evolved at the Inno{Hacks} Hackathon 2017 and was done in a team of 5 people.  

We love books. We're reading them, sharing them and discussing them. Diving totally in a foreign world. But something is missing. Sometimes the stories don't feel as alive as you might wanted it to be.  
With *Hansel & You* we want to change this! We're making the stories you love alive! So dive into it!

## But How?
Easy. You might already know some kind of interactive adventure books or something like that. But in times of tech and digital things everywhere we want to bring this kind of book in the year of 2017 and spice it up with some digital experience.  

To achieve this goal we decided to develop an Amazon Alexa Skill that will enable that kind of experience for you. On the one hand, you can listen to the story just like a regular Audiobook. But on the other hand you are the one who decides how the story will continue. What will happen to the world? What will happen to the characters? You have the power. Because it is your story. 

## The technical part
### The Skill set
### The voice of the story (Polly)
### Making decisions
### Bringing atmosphere (Phillips Hue)

## Our Sample story
In our short little sample story we will give you a brief introduction and overview in the world of interactive, voice driven stories.  

You're waking up in a room. No idea how you get there or where you actually are. But you know you have to get out of here. This isn't a nice kind of room you would be in for a longer period of time. You observe the environment and explore different corners of the room. Maybe you can find something useful.
