# Hansel & You. Stories alive.
This project has evolved at the Inno{Hacks} Hackathon 2017 and was done in a team of 5 people.  

We love books. We're reading them, sharing them and discussing them. But something is missing. Sometimes the stories don't feel that alive.  
With *Hansel & You* we want to change this! We're making the stories you love alive! So dive into it!

## But How?
Easy. You might already know some kind of interactive adventure books or something like that. But in times of tech and digital things everywhere we want to bring this kind of book in the year of 2017 and spice it up with some digital experience.
